When I was in grad school, I loved going to a coffee shop, ordering an espresso drink, and camping out for a few hours of studying. Heck, I'd still love to do this but life has caught up with me and I, unfortunately, cannot be a perpetual student. Anyway, I digress. So while I transitioned from being a student to a working professional, my coffee habit also flourished. As I now had a real paycheck and these daily trips to the coffee shop were a much smaller fraction of my income, my orders grew. 

On a typical trip to the coffee shop, I would now get an almond milk cortado, a small black coffee (to chase the strong espresso drink), and throw in an everything bagel. Also, I live in Austin where, for better or worse, this city makes you a food snob. You can't just have a taco for lunch, you need to have the best taco for lunch. Similarly, I wasn't going to any coffee shop but the best one in Austin: Epoch Coffee in . Where both the customers and baristas are doing their part to 'Keep Austin Weird'.

Back to my habit: almond milk cortado for $4.99, a small black coffee for $2.99, and an everything bagel for $1.99. Throwing in tax plus a $2 tip (because who tips $1?), my daily habit ran $12.76.  That's $395.56 a month and $4746.72 per year. I was spending close to $5k/year on my morning coffee.

While I had gone to grad school and gotten a good paying job, I was otherwise an idiot.

## What changed?

All of these habits came to a grinding halt when I met my wife. She is beautiful and funny and my best friend but make no mistake about it: she cheap. Early on when we were dating, she was making maybe 1/3 of what I made but easily had 10x more in savings. It didn't take long before she was all over my daily trips to the coffee shop.

Many people could look at us when we were first dating and say we were financially incompatible. Fair assessment but I wouldn't stop there. Personal finances were not something we were perfectly aligned on initially. Heck, we're still not but we're a lot closer. I bring this up because I know people can be very harsh when one person is a lot better with money than their partner. All I have to say to this is that things change and sometimes a lot faster than you might expect them to.

It's really an ongoing process but the hard work took the better part of a year to get on the same page with our personal finances. When it came to my coffee habit, our solution was simple but certainly not easy to implement. A big part of that was simply buying a coffee maker, getting some quality beans, and dropping my daily trips to the coffee shop. Where I used to spend $12.76 a day, I'm now spending close to that a month or about 40 cents per day. Now maybe once or twice a month we'll take a trip to a coffee shop. This we can both live with.

I need to make it clear that I am actually totally okay with people having 'bad habits'. These are often things we do that bring us a lot of joy and fulfillment. The only challenge I recommend here is to be aware of your spending and simply optimize it to your liking. When I looked at my coffee bills, did I like what I saw? God no. Did I enjoy those trips to the coffee shop? Hell yeah. This told me that there was a balance to strike. While I theoretically could afford these trips and enjoyed them, they weren't in line with my financial goals and what, for me, should be a special occasion -- I was doing daily.

## What if I had invested that same money?

This is where things get scary. So I made <a href="/calculators/badhabits/" target="_blank">a calculator</a> that shows me how much this habit would really cost me if I kept it up over 40 years. One point three million dollars. That's right. If I took the same money I was spending on coffee and instead invested in a low-cost index fund, I'd have $1.3M in 40 years. I am glad I didn't actually do this for 40 years but it's worth realizing how much your bad habits actually cost. It's not just the price today, it's the lost compounding sometimes over long periods of time like 40 years.

## So where am I now?

I'm at peace with the money I lost and have much better systems in place from preventing me otherwise mindlessly spending like this again. Even though I now go to the coffee shop once a week or every two weeks, I'm still on a first-name basis with many of the baristas and they still have my order memorized. While I definitely would like going there every day, it's still a part of my regular experiences, saves me a lot of money, and has become a lot more special as I go so sparingly now.
