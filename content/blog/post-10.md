Coast FIRErs are a unique breed. They have the discipline to aggressively save but prefer to liberally glide into retirement -- confident the amount they've saved will be enough when their full retirement age arrives and no longer plan to contribute in the interim. With this slack in the budget, they often look to downshifting their jobs in exchange for something less stressful or time consuming for the few years before a full-on retirement.

Of course this approach relies on speculation. Speculation that inflation will not offset returns in the market and that the stock market will return some minimum on average. That is the great assumption of Coast FIRErs and, based on the last 150 years of stock market returns, it's not that wild of a risk within a 10-15 year time horizon.

## Criteria

We're now going to take a look at some of the top jobs for downshifting mid-career. The general criteria with these jobs is that: 

1. You can make a living wage with it.
2. You barely work (Live slow, die old).
3. You can do this job part-time.

## Jobs With Health Insurance

Before we get too far long, I do need to make an important distinction. In the US people primarily get their health insurance through their employer. That is, when you retire early, you need to have a plan in place for getting health insurance. For people that are at a typical retirement age, they can qualify Medicare but this is generally not an option if you are retiring at say 40 or 50. By and large, many people prefer company plans compared to the government health care plans which have high premiums, high deductibles, and fewer things are coverage. As health insurance is a major driver for employment, I'm going to split this out based on jobs which provide health insurance and those that will not. Starting with those that have health insurance, here goes.

### 1. Public Library Assistant

This is my absolute favorite. These people don't work and public libraries are everywhere. Minimally, they need people to keep the lights on. You can do this, receive a paycheck and health insurance all from the comfort of nice air conditioning and surrounded by books.

### 2. Hardware Store (Lowe's or Home Depot)

Ever walk into a hardware store and notice the sea of senior citizens with nametags and back braces? Old people know what's up. This is because you can get fantastic health insurance for part-time work. Even better, you get first dibs on appliance returns and a store discount.

### 3. Starbucks Barista

This one is actually so popular there's a sub-genre of FIRE called Barista FIRE where people plan to specifically coast into retirement as a barista. Again, with some restrictions, part-time workers have access to their health insurance plan and can actually do pretty well with tips. The only caveat I'd add to this is that certain stores can actually be stressful and very busy to work at so definitely keep that in mind if you decide to pursue this. 

### 4. Personal Trainer

I like this job because it actually kills two birds with one stone: you get paid and you get healthier. The only challenge would potentially be that you have to be in pretty good shape to transition to this. My only recommendation for that is to consider working with a personal trainer for a year or two before downshifting if you haven't before. This will help you get a better understanding of the day-to-day, get you in better shape, and potentially provide an 'in' for becoming a personal trainer.

## Jobs without Health Insurance

### 5. Consultant (for main job)

Many people within FIRE are actually making a good income as it is with their current profession. Instead of doing a massive pivot, they could instead continue doing their same job but drop down to fewer hours or work as a part-time contractor. This comes with it's additional responsibilities (e.g. running a business) but could be a way to continue bringing in a solid income and work fewer hours. An added benefit is that if you ever did want to go back to the workforce, your skills and experiences are still current.

### 6. Tutor/Coach

This is closely related to being a consultant but with a focus on helping and educating others in the field you're in. An example of this is that professionally, let's say you're a developer. There's plenty of HS parents willing to pay you good money to tutor their kiddo to be the next Mark Zuckerburg.


These are the 6 biggest jobs I've come across for transitioning into lower stress job during Coast FIRE. A few honorable mentions not included above because they failed to meet one or more of the criteria above: University Lab Manager, Uber/Lyft driver, Disney travel consultant, Underwater Basket Weaver. Thank you and if you have any other careers you'd add, please comment below.
