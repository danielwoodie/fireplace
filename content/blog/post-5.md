title: Determining Where You're At with FIRE
---

## Where to Start

You have to start by thinking about the finish line. Where do you want to be when you're financially independent? Obviously, you want to think about what your finances look like but you also want to be thinking about how you spend your time. Here's two questions to get started:

<div class="questions">
<u>Critical Questions</u>
<ol>
<li>How much will I spend annually?</li>
<li>How will I spend my time differently?</li>
</ol>
</div>

If you can answer these questions then you have a solid foundation for creating a strategy to build the wealth and life for FIRE.

For example, here are my answers to these questions. 

1. I will need $100,000/year. Monthly, this is about $9,000/month. That will be split out between

$1,000 health care (premiums & deductibles)
$1,000 property taxes
$1,000 home improvement
$3,000 food and entertainment
$2,000 travel
$1,000 Miscellaneous, gifts, etc.

2. I will spend my time differently by doing more of the things I already enjoy doing. The biggest things I enjoy doing are: spending time with my family, reading books, running, and playing music.

## Calculating Your FIRE Number

Using this estimate for annual expenses in retirement, you can now come up with what's called your FIRE number. The FIRE community disagrees on a lot but most people can agree that you need 25x your annual expenses invested in low-cost index funds to be considered financially independent.

For my case of wanting my annual expenses to be $100,000, this means I would need $2.5M invested. Let's unpackage this number.

## Seeing Where You're At

Estimating where you're at can be tricky business. In general, you want to calculate your net worth. From there you want to then remove any assets that will not be generating income in retirement (e.g. your primary residence). For example, your tabulations may look like the following:

Assets
1. Value of primary residence
2. Cash in savings
3. Retirement accounts
4. Brokerage accounts
5. College savings
Total:

Debts
1. Mortgage
2. Student Loans
Total: 

Net worth: 

Now here is the not so fun part. You need to go through and remove all of the assets which won't be generating income. Unfortunately, you can't remove any of the corresponding debts -- those will still need to be accounted for.

This step is important that you be as detailed as possible. Now you want to go through your current expenses and see how close you are to these actual estimates. It's important you get down to the penny on each item. I don't typically recommend you be that detailed as many of the heuristics for FIRE allow plenty of wiggle room -- that said, it's important you understand your expenses as closely as possible.

For those anticipating where I'm going with this, I'm not actually going to say you need to cut all the big ticket items in your budget. I take a slightly different approach, one popularized by the book "Your Money or Your Life" where instead you look at each item in your budget and ask whether or not you're happy with that expense. Once you've gone through each item you then think about what expenses you don't like and how you can cut these out of your regular budget. Obviously, you can't do this with items like a mortgage or a large credit card bill but you can work to expedite the process of minimizing these expenses.

To simplify, here are three questions:

1. How much do I spend each month? Get down to the penny for the last three months.
2. What things do I most enjoy spending on? 
3. What things do I least enjoy spending on? How can I cut this?

<div class="questions">
<u>Critical Questions</u>
<ol>
<li>What is the sum total of my assets?</li>
<li>What is the sum total of my debts?</li>
<li>What from my assets will not create passive income?</li>
<li>What is my net worth? What count towards my FIRE number?</li>
</ol>
</div>

## What about real estate?

In general, the FIRE community does not like real estate. While it's a great vehicle for building wealth and can be a great source of cash flow, many people consider it to be non-passive, especially when compared to low-cost index funds. That is, if you leave your day job because the cash flow from rental properties exceeds your expenses, then you're considered a landlord and not retired.

Do I agree with this? Absolutely not. Does this mean you shouldn't invest in real estate? Again, absolutely not. 

So how do real estate holdings count towards reaching your FIRE number? This is where everyone's situation is a little different. Here is my take on it: you don't count your primary residence towards reaching your FIRE number but you do count your primary mortgage towards your debt. 

If you have a rental property, you can count this in one of two ways. You can pick which way is most likely for your situation. The first way is to count the monthly or annual cash flow. If, for example, your annual expenses are $100k but your rental properties cash flow $10k/year then simply take the remainder as your updated expenses to calculate your FIRE number against ($90k * 25 now).

Alternatively and this tends to be more conservative, you can instead count the equity in the home towards additional net worth that you can invest in low-cost index funds. Obviously, you'll likely see different appreciation in your rental than a stock but, if you plan to liquidate the home and invest it, it's really not a big stretch to count this towards reaching your FIRE number. Specifically, if you own a home worth $300k and have a $200k mortgage then you have $100k in equity. This $100k can then be added towards your assets in reaching your FIRE number.


>1. Do you own any rental properties?
>2. Do you plan to sell it? Or continue to be a landlord in retirement?

## Is the path to FIRE linear?

Of course not. Not only are wealth gains not linear, they're exponential -- oftentimes the route to wealth follows many irregular advances.

You've done the hardest part which is not only getting started but getting oriented. Now it's onto developing a savings and investing strategy to put into practice for reaching your goals. Admittedly, people within FIRE often like to reach their goals faster and younger than typical retirees but if that's not your speed, that's totally fine.
