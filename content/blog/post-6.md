title: FIRE's Hierarchy of Needs
---

The primary impetus for FIRE centers on developing a budgeting strategy to successfully reach financial independence, preferably in a shorter than typical time frame. As both a participant and someone inclined to operationalize everything, I've developed a number of schemas or frameworks for building these strategies.

My favorite framework to steal from is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. This is a dogma from psychology for understanding general well-being and motivation. With the hierarchy of needs, there's the lowest layer which is "Physiological" -- if your physiological needs aren't being met (e.g. you're sick or hurt) then any of the subsequent layers can't be pursued in full. Similarly, if you're not meeting your safety and security (e.g. someone is threatening you) then you will de-prioritize friendships or gaining respect from others.

Given the mechanical nature of this hierarchy, I think you can see why squeezing this to fit the mold of FIRE would be so appealing. 

A quick note about Dave Ramsey. It must be mentioned that something like this exists already called Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps. Yes, these do exists and, yes, they help a lot of people gain some financial health. Aside from the fact that anything beyond baby step 3 is suspect, the aspirations of FIRE go pretty far beyond the baby steps and really don't capture the values of FIRE.


## What does the FIRE hierarchy of needs look like?

With Maslow (and Mr. Money Mustache) as inspiration, I've iterated and toiled away with constructing various hierarchies for different aspects of the FIRE journey. The one I keep coming back to is below.

### Active Income

Your income is the life-blood of your FIRE strategy which is why I've made it the foundation. Your income will dictate when you reach financial independence and to what extent you're able to spend in retirement. 

Income can be split out into active income and passive income. For the foundation, I'm really talking about active income or income you have to work for (like your job). This is in contrast to passive income which is income that comes in without effort, like a stock appreciating.

I know this can be an unpopular opinion but I'm a big proponent for a solid W2 income (or being in the corporate rat race). I know, the ultimate goal is to be financially independent so that you don't have to do these jobs. If you're able to, though, you can greatly accelerate your path to financial independence. If that's not your speed, that's fine. Regardless, I'd encourage exploring what energizes you the most and finding how to optimize the income from this.

Note about the hedonic treadmill. Like each of these layers, the bar will constantly move. I remember finishing graduate school and thinking about some large salary that, if I ever attained, I'd be set and wouldn't need any more. Just a few years later, my wife and I now bring in over double that high number and I still feel like we've got a ways to go. Judge me. I don't have any wisdom beyond the value of counting your blessings as you go; this won't make the treadmill stop but the perspective will bring you back down to earth.

### Balance Expenses

Notice how I didn't say lower expenses. This layer may very well be about lowering your expenses. Alternatively, you may simply look to shuffle your expenses or even increase them some. The method I recommend for balancing expenses is really the "Marie Kondo" method. If you're familiar with her, she's gained a tremendous amount of notoriety for tidying up people's spaces and promoting a more minimalistic approach to living. Her big claim to fame, though, is to ask yourself "Does this spark joy?" and if it does not to throw it out. Obviously, things like child support payments or life insurance premiums may not "spark joy" and are not on the chopping block for your budget. That said, there may be other items within your budget that isn't "sparking joy" that you can remove, like a magazine subscription or a streaming service you never use. 

After reviewing your budget it's critical to have a plan in place to either 1) have your income be greater than your expenses for saving and investing or 2) have a plan for getting there. Minimally, if your income does not cover your expenses then you need to lower your expenses and/or increase your income. Having your expenses balanced is critical to putting the wheels in motion for a sustainable FIRE strategy.

### Cash Savings

This is the part that most FIRE people hate and that is to have some cash. Most FIRE people hate this because of inflation -- if you carry $100 in a year that has 7% inflation then at the end of the year that same $100 is worth closer to $93; this depreciation is made even worse when compared against investing the same money. That said, there is a lot of value in having cash.

For those that are new to FIRE or otherwise inexperienced with money, the cash savings is critical because to have cash you have to balance your budget to some extent. That is, implied in having cash savings is that you're not spending more than you're bringing in. Not only do you have enough to pay your monthly bills but you have some left over to save as cash.

How much is enough cash? Mr Money Mustache says about two months worth of expenses. Dave Ramsey says closer to 6 months. I actually lean closer towards Dave Ramsey on this one but either are fine.

### Passive Income

This is probably where most people think FIRE starts but laying a solid foundation by getting through the previous layers is critical. Passive income takes a lot of forms. The FIRE community strongly prefers what's called low-cost index funds. These are great and is where most of my money goes each month. There is also real estate (which the FIRE community does not like) because it's not considered fully passive. While true, real estate investing is minimally worth understanding and picking a stance on for your FIRE strategy.

The passive income piece is really central piece of FIRE. When your passive income is greater than your expenses then you have reached financial independence and can retire early. I hope you can see why the lower levels are so critical then to enabling this layer to really run efficiently.

### Self-Actualization

Self-actualization occurs when all of the lower levels are working in synchrony to achieve your goals. Your active income is optimized, providing both the ability to cover your expenses and invest aggressively. Your budget is balanced such that you're maximizing expenses on things you enjoy and value, minimizing expenses that do the opposite, and having plenty left over to save and invest. You have some form of a cash cushion -- whether it's 2 months of expenses or a year, you have enough cash so that you're not impacted too heavily by month to month swings in income or investments. Lastly, you're investing. A lot. All of these layers working together will make up your FIRE strategy.
