<!-- What is your FIRE number? -->

Calculating your FIRE number is a critical first step in developing your strategy for retiring early. This number is the amount you need invested before you can retire. The basic thinking is that you'll have this amount of money invested in the stock market and sell off a portion periodically to cover your expenses. As a rule of thumb, most people in the FIRE community agree that you need 25 x your expected annual expenses invested in low-cost index funds. For example, let's say you spend $100k/year then you would need $2.5M invested before you can retire. If you spend $50k then $1.25M.


<!-- Why 25x? -->
You might be asking why 25x? This all comes from the Trinity Study which showed that you could safely withdraw 4% of an investment account and it would last through retirement. The basic math of going from 4% to 25x is as follows:

$$Investment \ Portfolio = 25 * Annual \ Expenses$$
$$\frac{1}{25}Investment \ Portfolio = Annual \ Expenses$$
$$.04*Investment \ Portfolio = Annual \ Expenses$$

The .04 shown as a proportion above simply becomes the 4% of the 4% rule.

## Figuring Out Your Annual Expenses
This can be a surprisingly complicated thing to do. I've included an example of what one might look like below. It's not perfect and the aim is to not be perfect. It can be made more specific with time. The aim is to get a good idea of roughly what your expenses will be and to build a strategy around that general understanding. With time, the numbers will become more solid.

| Items | Monthly Expense | Annual Expense | FIRE Number
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Health Insurance | $1,000 | $12,000 | $300,000 |
| Food (Groceries + Restaurants) | $2,000 | $24,000 | $600,000 |
| Housing (Property Taxes) | $1,000 | $12,000 | $300,000 |
| Housing (Bills) | $500 | $6,000 | $150,000 |
| Home Repairs / Improvements | $1,000 | $12,000 | $300,000 |
| Travel & Entertainment | $2,000 | $24,000 | $600,000 |
| Miscellaneous | $1,000 | $12,000 | $300,000 |
| Gifts | $500 | $6,000 | $150,000 |
| Total | $9,000 | $108,000 | $2,700,000 |


This is a $9,000/month budget or $108k/year. Will you spend like this every month? No. Some months will be more in certain areas and other months will be less. For example, you may take 6 trips (traveling with a family of 4) in a year totalling $24,000; many months you spend nothing on travel but on average you're spending $2,000/month. Tallying things up this way allows you to get a good idea of how you might spend in retirement. 

Using these numbers, your FIRE number is $2.7M ($108,000 * 25).

## Your Turn
Take this and make it your own. If you'd include your own categories or have very different amounts in these boxes, let me know in the comments below. If you're married, this could be a good activity to do a household. Having a good idea of what your annual expenses are help you not only understand what you need to retire but you can also start to see where you might want to spend a little less or maybe a little more.
