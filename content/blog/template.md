### Paragraphs 1 and 2

Using a bootstrap simulation we can get an idea of not just how things will pan out on average but also a distribution of potential outcomes. Using actual returns, we can get a potentially more realistic idea of what can happen over a longer time period. By repeating this 10 or 100 times we can get an idea of the variety of ways things may go.
  
That is, this data provides a rich set of return values to sample from to not only get estimates for future values but to also get a range of possible outcomes. A bootstrap simulation takes actual returns and randomly samples them over say a 30 year period. This process gets repeated say 1,000 times and you begin to get an idea about the range of possible outcomes. Using the same strategy as before with spending $100,000/year, starting with $0 invested, and then investing $75,000/year after that we get the following scenario:

<!-- Ezoic - in_content1 - mid_content -->
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113"> </div>
<!-- End Ezoic - in_content1 - mid_content -->
