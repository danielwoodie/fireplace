### Being a Teenager

Being a teenager is generally a blast. Aside from school and sports, your responsibilities are non-existent. Yes, you are growing up and going through the growing pains of understanding your life and the relationships around you, figuring out what you do and don't like to do. That said, the expectations are really quite low which can give you a great opportunity to start earning some extra cash.

One of the sweetest things for being a teenager is earning some actual income. I know for me, my parents gave me an allowance which allowed me to occasionally buy a new skateboard or a band shirt that I wanted. That is, if I saved up my $10/week allowance then I could eventually have enough to buy something I actually wanted. Otherwise, I had to wait until my birthday or Christmas and pray that my parents had listened to what I actually wanted.

Suffice to say, when I picked up a part-time job in high school -- I was floored at the money I was raking in. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a lot and really wasn't enough for any adult to live off of. For me, though, I was rich. I believe my first paycheck for two weeks of work was about $300. I spent it all with my friends going to the mall (malls were a thing back then) -- mostly buying Taco Bell, band shirts, and CDs.

All this is to say that getting a part-time job or a side-hustle as a teenager can be very liberating. Having money that you earned to do whatever you want with it is very empowering. I do recommend you be more strategic with the money you earn than I was but that will be for you to decide (not my money). 

After having been a teenager and witnessed some of my younger friends and family go through this, here's a few side-hustles or part-time jobs I recommend for teenagers.

### 1. Mowing Lawns

You can build a damn empire mowing lawns. I know because I had a cousin that did it and, still, as an adult, has a lawn mowing business that generates between $10,000-$20,000/summer. She does this all part-time, on top of her main job. 

Here is the basic math of mowing lawns: 1 yard takes half an hour and you can make $50 on that. Let's say you work for 4 hours Saturday and Sunday morning (8 hours/weekend). In that time you can make $800/weekend. You do this for 10 weeks of summer and you've got yourself $8,000.

### 2. Power Washing Driveways

This one is similar math to mowing lawns. The only downside is that you can probably only power wash a driveway once a year. That said, getting customers is relatively easy (Whose going to say no to a teenager offering to power wash their driveway?) and you can likely charge a little more because this is more of a luxury service than getting your lawn mowed. What's even better is you will instantly be able to see the fruits of your labor with a clean driveway or front entry-way.

### 3. Life Guard

Want to work on your tan while earning some cash? Look no further than being a life guard. This job does have many physical requirements so you do need to be a strong swimmer and be trained in CPR. There is also the occasional life saving that occurs as a life guard which is no light matter. So if you work well under occasional high pressure, this is generally a great part-time job for teenagers.

### 4. Tutor

This assumes you have some knowledge of a topic that many people want to learn. I did this more in graduate school but you can definitely tutor students that are simply younger than you. Depending on your proficiency, you can charge anywhere from $50-$100/hour. Get 10 students in a week and you're looking at $1,000/week. If you're doubting your abilities, there's a lot of reasons you'd be better than others -- you'd be better than someone older or with more education because you've likely taken the exact class this student is going through and the material is fresher for you. 

### 5. Stocking Shelves at Grocery Store

Ever wake up early, bummed that no one else is awake? If this isn't you then I wouldn't recommend this job. At every grocery store, in the few hours before they open for the day, there's staff that are re-stocking the shelves for the day. There's always openings for these kinds of jobs and every town typically has multiple grocery stores.

### 6. Movie Theater

Like air conditioning? What about popcorn and movies? This is the job for you. Movie theater's are also great because you get to watch the latest movies and can often get deals for your friends (free ninety-nine).

### 7. Second Shooter for Photographer

Have an interest in photography? Most events and weddings will have a professional photographer hired for the day to take pictures of the guests and main events. Some times this photographer will have an assistant working alongside them but they may also be working solo. For those working solo, rarely will you find someone that couldn't use an extra set of hands or second set of eyes working to capture some of the special moments from the day. Initially, this would likely be unpaid but after gaining some experience, you can likely start to get paid to be an active photographer's second shooter -- earning $100-$200/event.

### 8. Build Websites for Local Stores

This one is a bit of a stretch for teenagers but do you have any capability with technology? Including how to build websites? This could be a great way to earn some extra money. An example situation may look like this: there's a new local kitchen supply store that just opened in town. They need a website, minimally, to let people know they exist and to list their hours. This kind of website can be built in a few days and could bring in $1,000-$3,000/site. Aiming to get $10,000 this summer? Just sell 3 or 4 of these and you'll be set.
