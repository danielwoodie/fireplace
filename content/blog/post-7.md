### What is a love bank?

A love bank is an account that exists between you and everyone you have relationships with. If you make deposits into that person's bank, they will like you more; if you make withdrawals they will like you less. This is especially relevant for when you're having problems with your relationships -- often the accounts need to be re-balanced with extra deposits.

Many people will tell you that choosing your partner is a big part of your personal finance journey. The follow-up to that is divorce can be not only absolutely disastrous to your family and mental health but also bank account. If you're looking for strengthening your marriage or simply interested in having better relationships with people, you may benefit from understanding the 'love bank'.

I should preface this by saying I am not a couples counselor. Not even close. I'm a software developer that specializes in writing software to solve math problems. As you might imagine, there's not much that transfers from math and coding that can be useful to building lasting relationships. I've had to put in work to make my marriage stronger these are my  notes on what's been successful.

In short, I've managed to find a way to quantify my efforts to having a good marriage. Specifically, I try to make 2-3 deposits into my wife's "love bank" on a daily basis. I have found that this makes our lives happiest. If I drop that to making 1-2 deposits per day, things are fine but tend to be a little boring. If I start making 0 deposits per day (or worse, net taking from her bank), it can be all out Armageddon. It's really not pretty.

Also, before I get too far along, I'm telling this from the point of view about you making deposits. I do this because you really can't control whether someone is making deposits in your bank. I've found that when you start making deposits or someone's balance is high enough, they generally reciprocate the deposits. Notice how I just mentioned a balance. That's right, understanding where your partner's balance is at is important as well. For example, if your partner has had an especially draining week at work or maybe you've had the hard week and it's drained them, you may have to go above and beyond with your deposits to bring them out of it (e.g. doing say 5 deposits in a day). 

The part of this that I think brings the schema of the love bank to the next level is when it's further framed into the '5 Love Languages' or Physical Touch, Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, or Gifts. If you're not familiar with the '5 Love Languages', the key part is that everyone has their love language that they respond most to. For example, someone may really dislike physical touch but really feel accepted with words of affirmation. Alternatively, someone may feel really loved when they receive gifts or acts of service but quality time doesn't really do much for them. To this end, finding your partner's love languages is critical to optimizing your deposits in their love bank.

### Physical Touch

The key here is that you don't just communicate verbally but also with touch. When you go for stretches of time without using body language to show your partner affection, they will likely start to feel neglected. If your partner likes massages, offer to give them a massage. 

A note about being genuine. People sense pretty quickly if someone is being disingenuous, especially with physical touch. It's probably better to do nothing than to do something that doesn't feel right to you. That said, if you struggle with physical touch and it's one of your partner's love languages, expect to go outside your comfort zone; minimally, they should acknowledge when you're making an effort.

### Quality Time

Quality time generally boils down to doing an activity together that you each have a part in. This can take many forms but, more than anything, there's typically a lot of conversation going on. One general rule of thumb is that people love talking about themselves. If you can get someone to talk, the effect is that you're actually making a deposit in their account. Furthermore, if you are having a conversation with someone and you're doing most of the talking -- not only are you filling up your bank, you're also likely taking from the other person's bank.

What is the special sauce of quality time? Open-ended questions. If you're having a hard time getting your partner to engage or otherwise having a hard time asking engaging questions, I might look up a few good questions online and keep them handy for say an evening walk or dinner conversation.

### Words of Affirmation

I know I said in the last section that when you're talking, you're generally taking from someone's bank to put in your own. The only exception to that is when you recognize someone or let them know you see what they're doing. This is especially important when you're going through a grueling week together. For example if you're putting in a lot of hours in the office one week and may be slacking on some of your home responsibilities, it really makes a difference to send an unexpected text to let them know how much you appreciate how they make things still run smoothly.

As a developer, this might be the one I struggle with the most. The only feedback you get is when something is broken or, if the build passes, you get to keep your job.

### Acts of Service

Acts of Service are great because you can often make deposits in multiple banks with a single act. One example is packing your family lunches for the day. I'm the cook in the house and end up making my daughter lunch in the mornings. Recently, I've realized I can just double the portions of everything and send my wife off with a packed lunch as well. She absolutely loves it and really doesn't require much added effort on my end.

While there's ease in implementing acts of service, there's also hidden items that can be unexpected withdrawals. The acts I'm thinking of are: leaving things broken around the house or paying bills late. As I stare at an unopened pile of mail from this past week, I am definitely guilty of this.

### Gifts

These are pretty self explanatory. People generally love receiving gifts. Gifts are even better when there's nothing special to celebrate. One of my wife's favorite gifts was buying her some pajamas just out of the blue. These little surprises can be worth multiple deposits as well.

While it's important to make everyday special, it's extra important to recognize major life events. Someone get a new job? Anniversary? It doesn't necessarily have to be expensive, either; growing up in Texas, we always did home-cooked steak dinners. Not cheap but cheaper than buying it at a restaurant. 

### Note about finding your partners love languages

One key here is to experiment. Everyone is different and has different love languages. You may find that your partner responds to gifts but not touch. That's fine. Update your understanding of their love languages and adapt. It pays to be malleable in this process and expect that there's going to be a slight learning curve initially. That's part of the process.
