### Normal Person

Hello. Tis I, a normal person. Well, rather, I'm a person and I believe I can explain the stock market in pretty general terms.

Qualifications for being normal: I live in the same state I was born in, I am about average height and weight, and my favorite (cheap) restaurant is Taco Bell. And I'm old enough to remember the talking chihuahua they had in their commercials -- if that dog wasn't probably 30 years old, it'd be cool if they brought him back.

Okay. Now that I have my esteemed credentials out of the way, I'm going to try to explain the stock market is to a normal person. I will split this out into 1. the useful things and 2. the less useful but still relevant things. 

### The Useful Things

Owning a stock can make you money. For example, let's say you bought a stock for $5 on Monday and on Friday you sold the stock for $7. You just made $2 for doing literally nothing. Well, you held a stock for a week but, otherwise, you did nothing. Before some of the more advanced students in the class start interrupting, yes there are things called taxes which you have to pay and yes there is also the risk that the price of the stock could have gone down in the amount of time (meaning you lost money when you sold it).

How does a stocks price change? In a simple way, there are markets where stocks are bought and sold. This market is very different from a super market where prices are static, instead prices change rapidly -- sometimes multiple times in a second. The mechanics of how this works aside, you might imagine that same stock you bought for $5 on Monday. How did it become $7 on Friday? In short, there's a line of people willing to sell stocks at different prices. There may be 20 people willing to sell theirs at $5.01, 10 willing to sell theirs at $5.02, and so on. If there is some good news about the company you bought into, then there may be greater interest in buying this company's stock. So much so that the demand pushing the price all the way up to $7/share by Friday -- when you sold. This same flow of pricing works the same on the way down for the stock.

### How to Get Started

It is generally not recommended that you begin by buying individual stocks. Of course, you can. If there was a company that you really liked, then you could look up it's ticker symbol (usually 3 or 4 letter abbreviation of the company) and purchase a few shares of the company.

Instead, though, people generally recommend buying into mutual funds. A mutual fund is a collection of multiple stocks, also sold by the share. For example, there are what's called 'whole market' mutual funds which includes a diverse set of stocks representing the whole market. These are appealing because if a certain market (e.g. the tech sector) goes up, then you benefit from that by owning parts of that market. Additionally, let's say a certain market goes down (e.g. retail), then your entire portfolio isn't brought down because it's balanced by other markets that are going up. 

If you have absolutely never bought or sold a stock before, you can do all of this pretty easily online by opening a brokerage account. My favorite is [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com) but there's plenty of others that work just as well. After opening an account, transferring some money into it, you can then try to buy (and subsequently sell) a stock through this.

For simplicity, there is an index fund for the top 500 companies in the US (called the S&P 500). This fund goes back 150 years and, on average, has returned about 8% (after subtracting inflation). Jack Bogle is credited with actually creating these mutual funds and selling them through his company (Vanguard). Many of the large brokerages have their same versions, including Schwab and Fidelity. For forecasting how much a stock portfolio might be worth in a few years, you can set the expected return to 8% (or less) and see what the possible outcomes are.


### The Less Useful Things

What is an actual share? Let's say you started a company
