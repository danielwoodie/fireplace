### Retiring Early at 55

So you've worked most of your career and want to clock out a little early? Or you're much earlier in your career and are daydreaming of what it could look like to reach financial freedom before the common age of 65 and resign yourself to the community pool, spending your afternoon drinking margaritas, and hoping retirees are not still singing Jimmy Buffet songs. Whatever the case may be, 55 is your target age and you want to make sure you have all your ducks in a row so that you're secure in your retirement. 

Retiring at 55 gives you a lot more opportunities than retiring at 65. You're much more active, the probability of health issues is significantly lower, and you can likely spend time with your loved ones in more engaging and meaningful ways. Beyond that, you'll likely have some company of other early retirees and won't need to carry much stigma that those who retire much younger must carry. To retire with confidence you need to understand the basic inputs and ouputs of your financial situation. We will get more into this but the things you will need to understand are: day-to-day expenses, big ticket expenses, health insurance, retirement accounts, other income, taxes, and collecting standard retirement benefits like social security and medicare.

### Fear Setting

We all have goals in life. Sometimes we have too many goals in life and we spend a lot of time focusing on the ways we're going to achieve those goals in life. On the flipside, we also have fears in life but the thinking around fears is often nowhere as constructive. This is where fear setting comes in. It's similar to goal setting but for fears. Now, I don't want your fears to run away from your and cripple your dreams. On the contrary, fear setting is about spending time with your deepest fears, spending time with the consequences, and developing guard rails for to offset the risks. 

Here is an example: I fear that I will run out of money in retirement and will not be able to afford to live. Wow. Okay, I went there. Yes. That is a very legitimate fear for retirement. It happens, unfortunately. So let's spend some time with this. What else could go wrong? 

I fear that I will run out of money and will not be able to afford to live. In this same vein, here are more specific things that could happen (it helps to be as specific as possible). 

I fear that I will run out of money and lose my house.
I fear that I will lose purpose without a job and become depressed. 

Okay. Wow. These are some very frightening things. The good news is these things are not currently happening. Instead we can spend some time and develop solutions today for what will happen if these things do occur. Here are some follow ups to these specific fears. 

Regarding health care, I will set aside additional money to make sure I can afford monthly premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maxes.
Regarding my house, I will pay off my mortgage so I am indeed the owner of my house. 
For food, I will set aside additional money to make sure I can afford my groceries. Additionally, I will learn to grow vegetables in my yard and work today to minimize my food expenses.
For traveling to visit my family, I will make sure I've budgeted for traveling to visit my family and make sure there's money in my accounts for these trips.
If I really am low on money, I can also pick up a part-time job. It wouldn't be the end of the world and I might meet some cool people, too.

While living in those fears is definitely anxiety provoking, the solutions were all pretty straight forward. Yes, setting aside some additional money may take years away from your retirement but you will be minimizing these fears which are very real. 

Alright, that's enough about fear setting. I bring it up because it's useful to do every 6 months or so. I don't recommend replacing fear setting with your actual goal setting. It really doesn't take much to

### Understanding Your Expenses

Controlling your expenses is critical to success in retirement. Without first understanding your expenses, you really have no north star or guidepost for managing your finances overall, much less during retirement.

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**

- What has been my credit card statement for the last 6 months? Where does that money go?
- What are my monthly bills?
- What are my housing costs?
- How much do I spend on food?
- What is the bare minimum I need to live on? If I needed to cut back, what could I get it down to?
- Are there any big expenses coming up? Will I need a new car? What about improvements on the house?
- How am I going to get my health insurance? What will I spend on premiums/deductibles/out-of-pocket maxes?
- Do I plan to travel? How often? 

I find it's most useful to average out some of the big ticket items into monthly expenses. For example, I like to take my family on two big vacations per year and this costs about $6,000 per trip or $12,000 for the year. This money isn't spent uniformly throughout the year but for the sake of creating a budget, I would say I spend $1,000/month ($12,000/year) on travel. This same kind of averaging can be done for other big-ticket items like home improvements or cars.

### The 4% Rule

The 4% rule refers to the amount of money you can safely withdraw from your retirement investments. This all comes from the Trinity Study which backtested withdrawal strategies for the last 150 years of stock market data. They showed that withdrawing 4% of the account every year resulted in a >90% success rate (or not running out of money in 30 years). Moving this number up to 3%, the researchers showed that people would, 100% of the time not run out of money.

**Questions to Ask Yourself**

- How will I withdraw money? Monthly? Or annually?
- What will I do if the market is down?
- What will I do if the market is up?
- How do I approach inflation?
- How much cash will I hold? Will this change over time?

### Are there any gaps?

**Questions to Ask Yourself**

- Can I cover big ticket expenses with my withdrawal strategy?
- Will my kids need additional help with college? What about their wedding? Downpayment on their first home?
- What is the worst case scenario?
- What about actual collecting social security and medicare? When will I do that?

### Tax Considerations

**Questions to Ask Yourself**

- What are the tax implications for each of my investment accounts? Are there any accounts I can pull from to minimize these taxes?
- How much cash will I hold? 6 months of expenses? Or two years of expenses? Why?
- How will I withdraw money? How will I pay for taxes?
- Is there any reason that it would be good to have a low income for tax purposes this year?

### Health Insurance

Health insurance is easily one of the biggest deterrents to retiring early. 

**Questions to Ask Yourself**

- How will I get insurance? What will it cost?
- When will I begin collecting Medicare? What will that cost?
- Will I potentially need long-term care? What will that cost?

### Paragraphs 15 and 16

Using a bootstrap simulation we can get an idea of not just how things will pan out on average but also a distribution of potential outcomes. Using actual returns, we can get a potentially more realistic idea of what can happen over a longer time period. By repeating this 10 or 100 times we can get an idea of the variety of ways things may go.
  
That is, this data provides a rich set of return values to sample from to not only get estimates for future values but to also get a range of possible outcomes. A bootstrap simulation takes actual returns and randomly samples them over say a 30 year period. This process gets repeated say 1,000 times and you begin to get an idea about the range of possible outcomes. Using the same strategy as before with spending $100,000/year, starting with $0 invested, and then investing $75,000/year after that we get the following scenario:
